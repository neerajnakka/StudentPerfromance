# Student Perfromance using data mining 
Technologies used : Python,React,mongoDb,CSS,HTML,Jaavsript

Using advanced data mining techniques, I developed a predictive model for forecasting studentperformance. By conducting comprehensive data collection, cleaning, exploration, modal
building, and validation.
I employed sophisticated machine learning models to generate accurate predictions. 
Generate dataset is stored into mongoDb
student can see his performance by logging into the login page interface by using his credentials.
Data is fetched from databse like performance will be displayed using visual graphs to help users to understand more effectively and areas to be focussed more 
to improve the perfromance.
