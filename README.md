# StudentPerfromance using data mining 
displaying perfromance by using web interface built by react
student dataset is stored in mongoDb

Using advanced data mining techniques, I developed a predictive model for forecasting studentperformance. By conducting comprehensive data collection, cleaning, exploration, modal
building, and validation.
I employed sophisticated machine learning models to generate accurate predictions. 
Generate dataset is stored into mongoDb
student can see his performance by logging into the login page interface by using his credentials.
Data is fetched from databse like performance will be displayed using visual graphs to help users to understand more effectively and areas to be focussed more 
to improve the perfromance.
